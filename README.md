## Overview

**Sportz** is a backend service built for live sports coverage. It exposes REST endpoints for match and commentary management and uses WebSockets to push real-time score and play-by-play updates to connected clients with zero polling overhead.

Key engineering properties:

- **Strict input validation** via Zod schemas on every REST and WS message
- **Backpressure protection** — closes sockets whose buffer exceeds 1 MB
- **Rate limiting** built into the WS layer (20 burst, 10 msg/sec)
- **Application-layer bot protection** via Arcjet, blocking automated scrapers and credential-stuffing bots before they hit business logic
- **Live observability** through Site24x7 APM with Apdex, error rate, and per-component response time tracking
- **GitHub Copilot** used for boilerplate and beginner tasks, keeping engineering focus on architecture and business logic

    └── WS    ──►  ws Server

                      └── Backpressure guard
```

### Multi-Instance Horizontal Scaling (Recommended for Production)

When scaling horizontally, individual servers don't share WebSocket state. A Pub/Sub broker (Redis / NATS / Kafka) bridges that gap so every server instance receives and forwards every broadcast regardless of which instance the originating client is connected to.

> ![Pub/Sub Pattern](assets/pubsub_pattern.png)
> *Redis Pub/Sub pattern for multi-instance WebSocket broadcasting — servers publish events to a shared channel, and all subscribers receive them in real time*

**Data flow:**

1. User A triggers a score update → Server 1 receives it
2. Server 1 **publishes** the event to the Redis `AAPL` channel
3. Server 2 (subscribed to the same channel) receives the broadcast from Redis
4. Server 2 **pushes** the update to its own connected clients

This decouples servers completely — Server 1 never needs to know Server 2 exists.

> **Note:** Auth is intentionally omitted in this project to keep focus on WebSocket mechanics and architecture.

---

## REST API Reference

### Matches

#### `GET /matches`

List all matches.

```
GET /matches?limit=50
```

**Response** — Array of match objects with computed `status`.

---

#### `POST /matches`

Create a new match.

```json
{
  "sport": "football",
  "homeTeam": "FC Neon",
  "awayTeam": "Drizzle United",
  "startTime": "2025-02-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "endTime": "2025-02-01T13:45:00.000Z"
}
```

Status (`scheduled` | `live` | `finished`) is **computed** from `startTime` and `endTime` — do not pass it manually.

---

### Commentary

#### `GET /matches/:id/commentary`

List commentary for a match.

```
GET /matches/:id/commentary?limit=100
```

---

#### `POST /matches/:id/commentary`

Add a commentary entry to a live match.

```json
{
  "minute": 42,
  "sequence": 120,
  "period": "2nd half",
  "eventType": "goal",
  "actor": "Alex Morgan",
  "team": "FC Neon",
  "message": "GOAL! Powerful finish from the edge of the box.",
  "metadata": { "assist": "Sam Kerr" },
  "tags": ["goal", "shot"]
}
```

> Only `live` matches accept new commentary. Attempts on `scheduled` or `finished` matches return a `409 Conflict`.

---

## WebSocket Protocol

### Connection

```
ws://localhost:8000/ws
```

Auto-subscribe to a match on connect:

```
ws://localhost:8000/ws?matchId=123
```

---

### Client → Server Messages

| Type | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subscribe` | `{ matchId: number }` | Subscribe to a match's live feed |
| `unsubscribe` | `{ matchId: number }` | Unsubscribe from a match |
| `setSubscriptions` | `{ matchIds: number[] }` | Replace all active subscriptions atomically |
| `ping` | — | Keepalive ping |

---

### Server → Client Messages

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `welcome` | Sent immediately after connection is established |
| `subscribed` | Confirms subscription to `matchId` |
| `unsubscribed` | Confirms removal of subscription |
| `subscriptions` | Full list of current active subscriptions |
| `commentary` | Live commentary event broadcast |
| `pong` | Response to client `ping` |
| `error` | Structured error with `code`, `message`, and optional `matchIds` |

**Commentary broadcast example:**

```json
{
  "type": "commentary",
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "matchId": 123,
    "minute": 42,
    "message": "GOAL! Powerful finish from the edge of the box.",
    "eventType": "goal"
  }
}
```

**Error example:**

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "code": "match_not_found",
  "message": "Match 999 not found",
  "matchIds": [999]
}
```

---

### WS Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Max subscriptions per socket | 50 |
| Rate limit | 20 burst / 10 msg/sec |
| Max message payload | 1 MB |
| Backpressure threshold | 1 MB buffered → socket closed |

## 🛡 Security — Arcjet Bot Protection

Arcjet is embedded at the application layer to block automated clients — scrapers, credential-stuffing bots, and aggressive API crawlers — before they hit business logic or inflate compute costs.

> ![Arcjet Bot Protection](assets/bot_protection_arcjet.png)
> *Arcjet `BOT_V2` engine blocking a bot attempting `POST /api/v1/auth/sign-in` — the request arrived with completely empty headers, a definitive automated script fingerprint. Arcjet returned `403 Forbidden` instantly.*

**How detection works:**

- **User-Agent analysis** — Flags non-browser or missing UA strings
- **IP reputation** — Cross-references known malicious IP ranges
- **Header fingerprinting** — Real browsers always send `User-Agent`, `Accept-Language`, `Host`, etc. Empty headers (`headers: {}`) are an unambiguous bot signal
- **`BOT_V2` engine** — Arcjet's updated detection layer that evaluates all signals together for a `DENY` / `ALLOW` verdict

Protection is applied to sensitive routes (auth, commentary write) where automated abuse is highest risk.

## Monitoring — Site24x7 APM

Site24x7 provides real-time application performance monitoring with Apdex scoring, per-component latency breakdown, and uptime tracking.

> ![Site24x7 APM Dashboard](assets/site24x7_Application_Performance_Metrics.png)
> *24-hour APM view: Apdex 0.994, avg response 140 ms, 28.41K total requests — with a `NODEJS-CORE` spike to 5,796 ms isolated at 08:39 AM*

**Key metrics tracked:**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Apdex Score | 0.994 | 100% satisfied users, 0% frustrated |
| Avg Response Time | 140 ms | Healthy baseline |
| Throughput | 19.7 rpm | 28.41K requests over 24h |
| Error Rate | 2.1% | Minor edge cases flagged for debugging |

**Bottleneck identification:**

During a peak traffic spike at 08:39 AM, the `NODEJS-CORE` component accounted for 5,796 ms of latency vs. just 4 ms for `createServer`. This points directly to event-loop blocking or a heavy synchronous task in the Node.js backend — exactly the kind of signal that's invisible without component-level APM breakdown.

**Uptime:**

The events timeline captured multiple short outages between 08:00–09:00 PM, a prolonged gap around 03:00 AM, and frequent drop-offs between 06:00–12:00 PM — all pinpointed to the minute for targeted debugging.

---

## Scaling to Multi-Instance

The current architecture runs on a single server. For horizontal scaling:

**The problem:** Multiple Node.js instances don't share WebSocket subscription state. A broadcast on Server 1 never reaches clients on Server 2.

**The solution:** Introduce Redis (or NATS / Kafka) as a shared Pub/Sub broker:

```bash
npm install ioredis
```

```js
// publisher (any server that receives a commentary write)
await redis.publish(`match:${matchId}`, JSON.stringify(commentaryPayload));

// subscriber (all WS server instances on startup)
redisSub.subscribe(`match:${matchId}`);
redisSub.on('message', (channel, message) => {
  broadcastToLocalClients(channel, JSON.parse(message));
});
```

Every server subscribes to Redis. When any instance publishes, all others receive it and forward to their locally connected clients. Server count becomes irrelevant to delivery guarantees.
